## Image Loading Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Problem
Images were not displaying due to Next.js image hostname configuration.

### Solution
Added localhost to `next.config.js`:

```javascript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: "http",
      hostname: "localhost",
    },
    // ... other patterns
  ],
}
```

### Image URLs
- Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/uploads/images/...`
- Served via: `src/app/api/uploads/[...path]/route.ts`
- Storage: `public/uploads/` directory

Images should now load correctly in the feed!

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed. The system uses:
- Existing database connection
- Existing auth system
- Local storage for images (already configured)

### Database Migration
Ensure migrations are run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Seed Data
Ensure moderation categories are seeded:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/seed.sql
```

Or verify in database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM moderation_categories WHERE is_active = true;
```

Should return 10 active categories including copyright.
