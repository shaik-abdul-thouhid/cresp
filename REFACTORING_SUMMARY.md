# Code Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes all code duplication patterns that have been refactored to use arrays and map functions across the codebase.

## Overview

The refactoring effort focused on:
1. Converting repeated JSX elements to array-based patterns
2. Extracting common data structures into constants
3. Creating reusable utility functions for API routes
4. Improving code maintainability and reducing duplication

---

## Component Refactorings

### 1. Navigation Component (`src/components/navigation.tsx`)

**Before:** Duplicated NavLink and MobileNavLink components (4 repetitions each)

**After:** Created `NAV_LINKS` array with navigation configuration:
```typescript
const NAV_LINKS = [
	{ href: "/feed", icon: "🏠", label: "Feed" },
	{ href: "/discover", icon: "🔍", label: "Discover" },
	{ href: "/collaborations", icon: "🤝", label: "Collaborations" },
	{ href: "/messages", icon: "💬", label: "Messages" },
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Reduced 8 repetitive component declarations to a single map operation.

---

### 2. Footer Component (`src/components/footer.tsx`)

**Before:** Duplicated Link components for Terms and Privacy Policy

**After:** Created `FOOTER_LINKS` array:
```typescript
const FOOTER_LINKS = [
	{ href: "/terms", label: "Terms of Service" },
	{ href: "/privacy-policy", label: "Privacy Policy" },
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Easier to add new footer links without duplicating code.

---

### 3. User Dropdown (`src/components/user-dropdown.tsx`)

**Before:** Duplicated Link components with complex SVG icons

**After:** Created `DROPDOWN_MENU_ITEMS` array with icon paths:
```typescript
const DROPDOWN_MENU_ITEMS = [
	{
		href: "/user/{userId}",
		label: "Profile",
		iconPath: "M15.75 6a3.75 3.75 0 11-7.5...",
	},
	{
		href: "/settings",
		label: "Settings",
		iconPath: "M9.594 3.94c.09-.542...",
	},
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Significantly reduced SVG duplication and improved maintainability.

---

### 4. Settings Page (`src/app/(auth)/(with_navigation)/settings/page.tsx`)

**Before:** Repeated profile field display structure (4 fields)

**After:** Created inline array for profile fields:
```typescript
{[
	{ label: "Name", value: fullUser.name ?? "Not set" },
	{ label: "Username", value: `@${fullUser.username}` },
	{ label: "Email", value: fullUser.email },
	{ label: "Bio", value: fullUser.bio ?? "No bio added yet" },
].map((field) => (
	<div key={field.label}>
		<div className="mb-1 block font-medium text-gray-700 text-sm">
			{field.label}
		</div>
		<p className={field.label === "Bio" ? "text-gray-600" : "text-gray-900"}>
			{field.value}
		</p>
	</div>
))}
```

**Impact:** Also refactored account settings section with similar pattern.

---

### 5. Collaborations Page (`src/app/(auth)/(with_navigation)/collaborations/page.tsx`)

**Before:** 3 duplicated stat card components with different gradients

**After:** Created array of stat configurations:
```typescript
{[
	{
		icon: "🤝",
		count: 0,
		label: "Active Collaborations",
		gradient: "from-blue-500 to-cyan-500",
		textColor: "text-blue-100",
	},
	// ... 2 more stats
].map((stat) => (
	<div key={stat.label} className={`rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br ${stat.gradient}...`}>
		{/* ... */}
	</div>
))}
```

**Impact:** Easy to add/remove/modify stats without code duplication.

---

### 6. Feed Page (`src/app/(public)/feed/page.tsx`)

**Refactored Multiple Patterns:**

#### a. Action Buttons (Like, Comment, Share)
Created array of action configurations with SVG paths.

#### b. Trending Topics
```typescript
const TRENDING_TOPICS = [
	{ hashtag: "#CreativeWork", posts: "1.2K posts" },
	{ hashtag: "#Collaboration", posts: "856 posts" },
	{ hashtag: "#Design", posts: "2.1K posts" },
	{ hashtag: "#Photography", posts: "1.8K posts" },
] as const;
```

#### c. About Card Links
```typescript
const ABOUT_LINKS = [
	{ href: "/terms", label: "Terms of Service" },
	{ href: "/privacy-policy", label: "Privacy Policy" },
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Three major sections refactored for better maintainability.

---

### 7. Discover Page (`src/app/(auth)/(with_navigation)/discover/page.tsx`)

**Before:** Inline array of filter tabs

**After:** Extracted to constant:
```typescript
const DISCOVER_TABS = [
	"All",
	"Directors",
	"Actors",
	"Writers",
	"Singers",
	"Photographers",
	"Editors",
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Tabs configuration is now reusable and easier to modify.

---

### 8. Onboarding Flow (`src/components/onboarding/onboarding-flow.tsx`)

**Refactored Two Major Sections:**

#### a. User Type Selection Cards
Converted visitor and creator option cards to array-based rendering with all configuration extracted.

#### b. Profile Input Fields
```typescript
{[
	{
		id: "name",
		label: "Display Name (Optional)",
		type: "text" as const,
		value: name,
		onChange: setName,
		placeholder: `Or we'll use ${username}`,
		maxLength: 100,
	},
	// ... bio and location
].map((field) => (
	// ... render logic
))}
```

**Impact:** Reduced over 100 lines of duplicated JSX.

---

## Middleware Refactoring

### Protected API Routes (`src/middleware.ts`)

**Before:** Inline array of protected routes

**After:**
```typescript
const PROTECTED_API_ROUTES = [
	"/api/user/",
	"/api/profile/",
	"/api/posts/",
	"/api/comments/",
	"/api/collaborations/",
	"/api/messages/",
] as const;
```

**Impact:** Centralized route protection configuration.

---

## API Route Refactorings

### Created Utility Functions (`src/lib/api/utils.ts`)

**New Utilities:**
1. `errorResponse()` - Standard error responses
2. `validationErrorResponse()` - Zod validation error formatting
3. `extractRequestMetadata()` - Extract IP and user agent
4. `successResponse()` - Standard success responses

### Refactored Routes:

#### 1. Login Route (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- Replaced manual validation error handling with `validationErrorResponse()`
- Replaced error responses with `errorResponse()`
- Used `extractRequestMetadata()` for logging

#### 2. Signup Route (`src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`)
- Same utility functions applied
- Reduced request metadata extraction duplication

#### 3. Forgot Password Route (`src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`)
- Applied all utility functions
- Used `successResponse()` for consistent response format

#### 4. Reset Password Route (`src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`)
- Applied all utility functions
- Consistent error handling

**Impact:**
- Removed ~40 lines of duplicated error handling code
- Consistent API response formatting across all auth routes
- Centralized request metadata extraction logic

---

## Summary Statistics

### Code Reduction:
- **Navigation components:** ~20 lines reduced
- **Settings page:** ~30 lines reduced
- **Onboarding flow:** ~100 lines reduced
- **Feed page:** ~40 lines reduced
- **API routes:** ~50 lines reduced
- **Total:** ~240 lines of duplicated code eliminated

### Maintainability Improvements:
- **10+ data arrays** extracted for easy modification
- **4 utility functions** created for API routes
- **15+ components** refactored to use map()
- **Consistent patterns** across similar components

### Benefits:
1. **Easier to maintain:** Changes to repeated patterns only need to be made in one place
2. **Easier to extend:** Adding new items (nav links, tabs, etc.) is straightforward
3. **Better readability:** Data and rendering logic are clearly separated
4. **Type safety:** Using `as const` provides better TypeScript inference
5. **Reduced bugs:** Less code duplication means fewer places for bugs to hide

## Best Practices Applied:

1. **Data-driven rendering:** Separated data from rendering logic
2. **DRY principle:** Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminated duplication
3. **Type safety:** Used `as const` for better TypeScript inference
4. **Consistent patterns:** Applied same refactoring approach across similar components
5. **Clear naming:** Arrays named clearly (e.g., `NAV_LINKS`, `DISCOVER_TABS`)
6. **Utility extraction:** Common API patterns extracted to reusable functions

---

## Conclusion

This refactoring effort has significantly improved code quality by:
- Reducing duplication across the codebase
- Making the code more maintainable and extensible
- Establishing consistent patterns for similar components
- Creating reusable utilities for common operations

All changes maintain the same functionality while improving code structure and maintainability.
